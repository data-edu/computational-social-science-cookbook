    "text": "2.1 Overview\nIn social sciences, analyzing text data is usually considered the “job” of qualitative researchers.Traditionally, qualitative research involves identifying patterns in non-numeric data, and this pattern recognition is typically done manually. This process is time-intensive but can yield rich research results. Traditional methods for analyzing text data involve human coding and can include direct sources (e.g., books, online texts) or indirect sources (e.g., interview transcripts).\nWith the advent of new software, we can capture and analyze text data in ways that were previously not possible. Modern data collection techniques include web scraping, accessing social media APIs, or downloading large online documents. Given the increased size of text data, analysis now requires computational approaches (e.g., dictionary-based, frequency-based, machine learning) that go beyond manual coding. These computational methods allow social scientists to ask new types of research questions, expanding the scope and depth of possible insights.",

    "section": "2.2 Accessing Text Data (Broadening the Horizon)",
    "text": "2.2 Accessing Text Data (Broadening the Horizon)\n\n2.2.1 Web Scraping (Unstructured or API)\n\nWhat is Web Scraping?\nWeb scraping refers to the automated process of extracting data from web pages. It is particularly useful when dealing with extensive lists of websites that would be tedious to mine manually. A typical web scraping program follows these steps:\n\nLoads a webpage.\nDownloads the HTML or XML structure.\nIdentifies the desired data.\nConverts the data into a format suitable for analysis, such as a data frame.\n\nIn addition to text, web scraping can also be used to download other content types, such as audio-visual files.\n\n\nIs Web Scraping Legal?\nWeb scraping was common in the early days of the internet, but with the increasing value of data, legal norms have evolved. To avoid legal issues, check the “Terms of Service” for specific permissions on the website, often accessible via “robots.txt” files. Consult legal advice when in doubt.\n\n\nReading a Web Page into R\nOnce permissions are confirmed, the first step in web scraping is to download the webpage’s source code into R, typically using the rvest package by Hadley Wickham.\n\n# Install and load the rvest package\ninstall.packages(\"rvest\")\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nTo demonstrate, we will scrape a simple Wikipedia page. Static pages, which lack interactive elements like JavaScript, are simpler to scrape. You can view the page’s HTML source in your browser by selecting Developer Tools &gt; View Source.\n\n# Load the webpage\nwikipedia_page &lt;- read_html(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000\")\n\n# Verify that the webpage loaded successfully\nwikipedia_page\n\n\n\nParsing HTML\nThe next challenge is extracting specific information from the HTML structure. HTML files have a “tree-like” format, allowing us to target particular sections. Use your browser’s “Developer Tools” to inspect elements and locate the data. Right-click the desired element and select Inspect to view its structure.\nTo isolate data sections within the HTML structure, identify the XPath or CSS selectors. For instance:\n\n# Extract specific section using XPath\nsection_of_wikipedia &lt;- html_node(wikipedia_page, xpath='//*[@id=\"mw-content-text\"]/div/table')\nhead(section_of_wikipedia)\n\nTo convert the extracted section into a data frame, use html_table():\n\n# Convert the extracted data into a table\nhealth_rankings &lt;- html_table(section_of_wikipedia)\nhead(health_rankings[ , (1:2)])  # Display the first two columns\n\n\n\nParsing with CSS Selectors\nFor more complex web pages, CSS selectors can be an alternative to XPath. Tools like Selector Gadget can help identify the required CSS selectors.\nFor example, to scrape event information from Duke University’s main page:\n\n# Load the webpage\nduke_page &lt;- read_html(\"https://www.duke.edu\")\n\n# Extract event information using CSS selector\nduke_events &lt;- html_nodes(duke_page, css=\"li:nth-child(1) .epsilon\")\nhtml_text(duke_events)\n\n\n\nScraping with Selenium\nFor tasks involving interactive actions (e.g., filling search fields), use RSelenium, which enables automated browser operations.\nTo set up Selenium, install the Java SE Development Kit and Docker. Then, start Selenium in R:\n\n# Install and load RSelenium\ninstall.packages(\"RSelenium\")\nlibrary(RSelenium)\n\n# Start a Selenium session\nrD &lt;- rsDriver()\nremDr &lt;- rD$client\nremDr$navigate(\"https://www.duke.edu\")\n\nTo automate data entry, identify the CSS selector for the search box and input the query:\n\n# Find the search box element and enter a query\nsearch_box &lt;- remDr$findElement(using = 'css selector', 'fieldset input')\nsearch_box$sendKeysToElement(list(\"data science\", \"\\uE007\"))  # \"\\uE007\" represents Enter key\n\n\n\nWeb Scraping within a Loop\nTo scrape multiple pages, embed the code within a loop to automate tasks across different URLs. Since each site may have a unique structure, generalized scraping can be time-intensive and error-prone. Implement error handling to manage interruptions.\n\n\nWhen to Use Web Scraping\nWeb scraping is appropriate if:\n\nPage structure is consistent across sites: For example, a government site with date suffixes but a uniform layout.\nManual data collection is prohibitive: For extensive text or embedded tables.\n\nWhen feasible, consider alternatives like APIs or data-entry services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) for better efficiency and legal compliance.\n\n\n\nWhat is an API?\nAn Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of protocols that allows computers to communicate and exchange information. A common type is the REST API, where one machine sends a request, and another returns a response. APIs provide standardized access to data, services, and functionalities, making them essential in software development.\n\nWhen to Use an API\nAPIs are commonly used for:\n\nIntegrating with Third-Party Services: APIs connect applications to services like payment gateways or social media.\nAccessing Data: APIs retrieve data from systems or databases (e.g., real-time weather data).\nAutomating Tasks: APIs automate processes within applications, such as email marketing.\nBuilding New Applications: APIs allow developers to build new apps or services (e.g., a mapping API for navigation).\nStreamlining Workflows: APIs enable seamless communication and data exchange across systems.\n\n\n\nUsing Reddit API with RedditExtractoR\nReddit is a social media platform featuring a complex network of users and discussions, organized into “subreddits” by topic. RedditExtractoR, an R package, enables data extraction from Reddit to identify trends and analyze interactions.\n\n# Install and load RedditExtractoR\ninstall.packages(\"RedditExtractoR\")\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\n# Access data from the GenAI subreddit\nGenAI_reddit &lt;- find_thread_urls(subreddit = \"GenAI\", sort_by = \"new\", period = \"day\")\nview(GenAI_reddit)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Audio Transcripts (Zoom, etc.)\nAudio transcripts are a rich source of text data, especially useful for capturing spoken content from meetings, interviews, or webinars. Many platforms, such as Zoom, provide automated transcription services that can be downloaded as text files for analysis. By processing these transcripts, researchers can analyze conversation themes, sentiment, or other linguistic features. Here’s how to access and prepare Zoom transcripts for analysis in R.\n\nKey Steps for Extracting Text Data from Audio Transcripts\n\nAccess the Zoom Transcript\n\nLog in to your Zoom account.\nNavigate to the “Recordings” section.\nSelect the recording you wish to analyze and download the “Audio Transcript” file.\n\nImport the Transcript into R\nOnce the file is downloaded, you can load it into R for analysis. Depending on the file format (usually a .txt file with tab or comma delimiters), use read.table(), read.csv(), or functions from the readr package to load the data.\n\n\n   # Load the transcript into R\n   transcript_data &lt;- read.table(\"path/to/your/zoom_transcript.txt\", sep = \"\\t\", header = TRUE)\n\nAdjust the sep parameter based on the delimiter used in the transcript file (typically \\t for tab-delimited files).\n\nData Cleaning (if necessary)\nClean up the text data to remove unnecessary characters, standardize formatting, and prepare it for further analysis.\n\nRemove Unwanted Characters\nUse gsub() to eliminate special characters and punctuation, keeping only alphanumeric characters and spaces.\n\n\n     # Remove special characters\n     transcript_data$text &lt;- gsub(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]\", \"\", transcript_data$text)\n\n\nConvert Text to Lowercase\nStandardize text to lowercase for consistency in text analysis.\n\n\n\n     # Convert text to lowercase\n     transcript_data$text &lt;- tolower(transcript_data$text)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 PDF\nPDF files are a valuable source of text data, often found in research publications, government documents, and industry reports. We’ll explore two main methods for extracting text from PDFs:\n\nExtracting from Local PDF Files: This method involves accessing and parsing text from PDF files stored locally, providing tools and techniques to efficiently retrieve text data from offline documents.\nDownloading and Extracting PDF Files: This approach covers downloading PDFs from online sources and extracting their text. This method is useful for scraping publicly available documents from websites or databases for research purposes.\nPDF Data Extractor (PDE)\nFor more advanced PDF text extraction and processing, you can use the PDF Data Extractor (PDE) package. This package provides tools for extracting text data from complex PDF documents, supporting additional customization options for text extraction. PDE is a R package that easily extracts information and tables from PDF files. The PDE_analyzer_i() performs the sentence and table extraction while the included PDE_reader_i() allows the user-friendly visualization and quick-processing of the obtained results.\n\n\nSteps for Extracting Text from Local PDF Files\n\nInstall and Load the pdftools Package\nStart by installing and loading the pdftools package, which is specifically designed for reading and extracting text from PDF files in R.\n\n\n   install.packages(\"pdftools\")\n   library(pdftools)\n\n\nRead the PDF as a Text File\nUse the pdf_text() function to read the PDF file into R as a text object. This function returns each page as a separate string in a character vector.\n\n\n   txt &lt;- pdf_text(\"path/to/your/file.pdf\")\n\n\nExtract Text from a Specific Page\nTo access a particular page from the PDF, specify the page number in the text vector. For example, to extract text from page 24:\n\n\n   page_text &lt;- txt[24]  # page 24\n\n\nExtract Rows into a List\nIf the page contains a table or structured text, use the scan() function to read each row as a separate element in a list. The textConnection() function converts the page text for processing.\n\n\n   rows &lt;- scan(textConnection(page_text), what = \"character\", sep = \"\\n\")\n\n\nSplit Rows into Cells\nTo further parse each row, split it into cells by specifying the delimiter, such as whitespace (using \"\\\\s+\"). This converts each row into a list of individual cells.\n\n\n   row &lt;- unlist(strsplit(rows[24], \"\\\\s+\"))  # Example with the 24th row\n\n\n\nSteps for Downloading and Extracting Text from PDF Files\n\nDownload the PDF from the Web\nUse the download.file() function to download the PDF file from a specified URL. Set the mode to \"wb\" (write binary) to ensure the file is saved correctly.\n\n\n   link &lt;- paste0(\n     \"http://www.singstat.gov.sg/docs/\",\n     \"default-source/default-document-library/\",\n     \"publications/publications_and_papers/\",\n     \"cop2010/census_2010_release3/\",\n     \"cop2010sr3.pdf\"\n   )\n   download.file(link, \"census2010_3.pdf\", mode = \"wb\")\n\n\nRead the PDF as a Text File\nAfter downloading, read the PDF into R as a text object using the pdf_text() function from the pdftools package. Each page of the PDF will be stored as a string in a character vector.\n\n\n   txt &lt;- pdf_text(\"census2010_3.pdf\")\n\n\nExtract Text from a Specific Page\nAccess the desired page (e.g., page 24) by specifying the page number in the character vector.\n\n\n   page_text &lt;- txt[24]  # Page 24\n\n\nExtract Rows into a List\nUse the scan() function to split the page text into rows, with each row representing a line of text in the PDF. This creates a list where each line from the page is an element.\n\n\n   rows &lt;- scan(textConnection(page_text), what = \"character\", sep = \"\\n\")\n\n\nLoop Through Rows and Extract Data\nStarting from a specific row (e.g., row 7), loop over each row. For each row:\n\nSplit the text by spaces (\"\\\\s+\") using strsplit().\nConvert the result to a vector with unlist().\nIf the third cell in the row is not empty, store the second cell as name and the third cell as total, converting it to a numeric format after removing commas.\n\n\n\n   name &lt;- c()\n   total &lt;- c()\n\n   for (i in 7:length(rows)) {\n     row &lt;- unlist(strsplit(rows[i], \"\\\\s+\"))\n     if (!is.na(row[3])) {\n       name &lt;- c(name, row[2])\n       total &lt;- c(total, as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", row[3])))\n     }\n   }\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Survey, Discussions, etc.\nSurveys and discussion posts are valuable sources of text data in social science research, providing insights into participants’ perspectives, opinions, and experiences. These data sources often come from open-ended survey responses, online discussion boards, or educational platforms. Extracting and preparing text data from these sources can reveal recurring themes, sentiment, and other patterns that support both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Below are key steps and code examples for processing text data from surveys and discussions in R.\n\nKey Steps for Processing Survey and Discussion Text Data\n\nLoad the Data\nSurvey and discussion data are typically stored in spreadsheet formats like CSV. Begin by loading this data into R for processing. Here, readr is used for reading CSV files with read_csv().\n\n\n   # Install and load necessary packages\n   install.packages(\"readr\")\n   library(readr)\n   \n   # Load data\n   survey_data &lt;- read_csv(\"path/to/your/survey_data.csv\")\n\n\nExtract Text Columns\nIdentify and isolate the relevant text columns. For example, if the text data is in a column named “Response,” you can create a new vector for analysis.\n\n\n   # Extract text data from the specified column\n   text_data &lt;- survey_data$Response\n\n\nData Cleaning\nPrepare the text data by cleaning it, removing any unnecessary characters, and standardizing the text. This includes removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and handling extra whitespace.\n\nRemove Unwanted Characters\nUse gsub() from base R to remove any non-alphanumeric characters, retaining only words and spaces.\n\n\n\n     # Remove special characters\n     text_data &lt;- gsub(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]\", \"\", text_data)\n\n\nConvert to Lowercase\nStandardize the text by converting all characters to lowercase.\n\n\n     # Convert text to lowercase\n     text_data &lt;- tolower(text_data)\n\n\nRemove Extra Whitespace\nRemove any extra whitespace that may be left after cleaning.\n\n\n     # Remove extra spaces\n     text_data &lt;- gsub(\"\\\\s+\", \" \", text_data)\n\n\nTokenization and Word Counting (Optional)\nIf further analysis is needed, such as frequency-based analysis, split the text into individual words (tokenization) or count the occurrence of specific words. Here, dplyr is used to organize the word counts.\n\n\n   # Install and load necessary packages\n   install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n   library(dplyr)\n   \n   # Tokenize and count words\n   word_count &lt;- strsplit(text_data, \" \") %&gt;%\n                 unlist() %&gt;%\n                 table() %&gt;%\n                 as.data.frame()",

This approach aligns with the frequency-coding method (Saldana) and can supplement human coding by revealing the most/least commonly occurring words, which can then be compared across dependent variables.\n\nCase Study: Frequency-Based Analysis of GenAI USage Guidelines in Higher Education\nAs AI writing tools like ChatGPT become more prevalent, educators are working to understand how best to integrate them within academic settings, while many students and instructors remain uncertain about current allowances. Our research into AI usage guidelines from the top 100 universities in North America aims to identify prominent themes and concerns in institutional policies regarding GenAI.\n\n\nData Source\nThe dataset consists of publicly available AI policy texts from 100 universities(USA), the data has been downloaded and saved as a CSV file for analysis.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Sample Research Questions\n\nRQ1: What are the most frequently mentioned words in university GenAI writing usage policies?\nRQ2: Which keywords reflect common concerns or focal points related to GenAI writing usage in academic settings?\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Analysis\n\nStep 1: Load Required Libraries\nInstall and load libraries for data processing, visualization, and word cloud generation.\n\n# Install necessary packages if not already installed\n#install.packages(c(\"tibble\", \"dplyr\", \"tidytext\", \"ggplot2\", \"viridis\",\"tm\",wordcloud\" \"wordcloud2\",\"webshot\"))\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(tm)\nlibrary(wordcloud)\nlibrary(wordcloud2)\nlibrary(webshot)\n\n\n\nStep 2: Load Data\nRead the CSV file containing policy texts from the top 100 universities.\n\n# Load the dataset\nuniversity_policies &lt;- read_csv(\"University_GenAI_Policy_Stance.csv\")\n\n\n\nStep 3: Tokenize Text and Count Word Frequency\nProcess the text data by tokenizing words, removing stop words, and counting word occurrences.\n\n# Tokenize text, remove stop words, and count word frequencies\nword_frequency &lt;- university_policies %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, Stance) %&gt;%  # Tokenize the 'Policy_Text' column\n  anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;%             # Remove common stop words\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)              # Count and sort words by frequency\nword_frequency\n\n# A tibble: 1,108 × 2\n   word            n\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 ai            124\n 2 students      120\n 3 chatgpt        80\n 4 tools          73\n 5 academic       68\n 6 policy         35\n 7 assignments    34\n 8 instructors    34\n 9 integrity      33\n10 student        32\n# ℹ 1,098 more rows\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create a Word Cloud\nGenerate a word cloud to visualize the frequency of words in a circular shape.\n\n# Create and display the GenAI usage Stance wordcloud\n\nwordcloud(words = word_frequency$word, freq = word_frequency$n, scale = c(4, 0.5), random.order = FALSE, min.freq = 10, colors = brewer.pal(8, \"Dark2\"), rot.per = 0.35)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Visualize Top 12 Words in University Policies\nSelect the top 12 most frequent words and create a bar chart to visualize the distribution.\n\n# Select the top 12 words\ntop_words &lt;- word_frequency %&gt;% slice(1:12)\n\n# Generate the bar chart\npolicy_word_chart &lt;- ggplot(top_words, aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = word)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top Words in University GenAI Policies\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Frequency\",\n    caption = \"Source: University AI Policy Text\",\n    fill = \"Word\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = 0.5, hjust = -0.1, size = 3)\n\n# Print the bar chart\nprint(policy_word_chart)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Results and Discussions\n\nRQ1: What are the most frequently mentioned words in university GenAI writing usage policies?\nThe frequency analysis shows that keywords such as “assignment,” “student,” and “writing” are among the most commonly mentioned terms across AI policies at 100 universities. This emphasis reflects a focus on using AI tools to support student learning and enhance teaching content. The frequent mention of these words suggests that institutions are considering the role of AI in academic assignments and course design, indicating a strategic commitment to integrating AI within educational tasks and student interactions.\nRQ2: Which keywords reflect common concerns or focal points related to GenAI writing usage in academic settings?\nThe analysis of the top 12 frequently mentioned terms highlights additional focal points, including “tool,” “academic,” “instructor,” “integrity,” and “expectations.” These terms reveal concerns around the ethical use of AI tools, the need for clarity in academic applications, and the central role of instructors in AI policy implementation. Keywords like “integrity” and “expectations” emphasize the importance of maintaining academic standards and setting clear guidelines for AI use in classrooms, while “instructor” underscores the influence faculty members have in shaping AI-related practices. Together, these terms reflect a commitment to transparent policies that support ethical and effective AI integration, enhancing the academic experience for students.",

Institutions are keen on setting clear guidelines for both students and instructors to avoid misuse.\nTheme 2: Underlines the potential for conflict between maintaining academic standards (honor, expectations) and leveraging AI to support learning. This shows a cautious approach to integrating AI while upholding traditional values.\nTheme 3: Raises policy-level questions on AI governance, such as whether existing institutional frameworks are adequate to regulate emerging generative AI technologies.\nOpportunities:\nTheme 1: Presents a chance to redefine how students interact with AI tools to foster responsible and innovative usage, particularly for assignments and creative tasks.\nTheme 2: Encourages collaboration between faculty and administration to develop robust expectations and support systems for integrating AI in the classroom.\nTheme 3: Offers a strategic opportunity for universities to lead in AI adoption by establishing comprehensive policies that guide AI’s role in education and research.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\nThe topic modeling results suggest that universities are navigating a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges as they incorporate GenAI into academic contexts. While student-centric policies aim to balance innovation with ethical considerations, institutional-level themes signal the need for governance frameworks to ensure responsible AI use. These findings indicate that higher education institutions are positioned to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of generative AI in learning, provided they address the ethical, pedagogical, and policy challenges identified in this analysis.",

IPEDS Data and Supervised Learning\n\nGoal: Develop models to predict institutional enrollment rates based on financial aid, demographics, and program offerings.\nExample: Use logistic regression to forecast whether a student is likely to enroll based on financial aid eligibility.\n\n\n\n3. OULAD Data and Supervised Learning\n\nGoal: Predict student outcomes (e.g., pass/fail) based on engagement metrics like forum participation and assignment submissions.\nExample: Train a random forest model to classify students as “at-risk” or “not at-risk” based on weekly interaction data.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the Right Supervised Learning Approach\nWhen applying supervised learning in Learning Analytics: 1. Define the Goal: Clearly articulate the outcome you want to predict (e.g., performance, enrollment, or engagement). 2. Select an Algorithm: Choose an appropriate model based on the data and prediction task. - For continuous outcomes, use regression models. - For categorical outcomes, use classification models like logistic regression or random forests. 3. Feature Engineering: Select and preprocess relevant features (e.g., attendance, demographics, assignment scores) to improve model accuracy. 4. Evaluate Model Performance: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or R-squared to assess model effectiveness.\nIntegrating supervised learning techniques into Learning Analytics, researchers and practitioners can leverage big data to make data-driven predictions and decisions, ultimately enhancing educational outcomes.",

    "text": "5.3 Logistic Regression ML\n\n5.3.1 Purpose + CASE\n\nPurpose\nLogistic regression is a supervised learning technique widely used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of an event occurring (e.g., success vs. failure) based on a set of predictor variables. Logistic regression is particularly effective in educational research for predicting outcomes such as retention, enrollment, or graduation rates.\n\n\nCASE: Predicting Graduation Rates\nThis case study is based on IPEDS data and inspired by Zong and Davis (2022). We predict graduation rates as a binary outcome (good_grad_rate) using institutional features such as total enrollment, admission rate, tuition fees, and average instructional staff salary.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Sample Research Questions (RQs)\n\nRQ A: What institutional factors are associated with high graduation rates in U.S. four-year universities?\nRQ B: How accurately can we predict high graduation rates using institutional features with supervised machine learning?\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Analysis\n\nLoading Required Packages\nWe load necessary R packages for data wrangling, cleaning, and modeling.\n\n# Load necessary libraries for data cleaning, wrangling, and modeling\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and visualization\nlibrary(tidymodels) # For machine learning workflows\nlibrary(janitor)    # For cleaning variable names\n\n\n\nLoading and Cleaning Data\nWe read the IPEDS dataset and clean column names for easier handling.\n\n# Read in IPEDS data from CSV file\nipeds &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ipeds-all-title-9-2022-data.csv\")\n\n# Clean column names for consistency and usability\nipeds &lt;- janitor::clean_names(ipeds)\n\n\n\nData Wrangling\nSelect relevant variables, filter the dataset, and create the dependent variable good_grad_rate.\n\n# Select and rename key variables; filter relevant institutions\nipeds &lt;- ipeds %&gt;%\n  select(\n    name = institution_name,                  # Institution name\n    total_enroll = drvef2022_total_enrollment, # Total enrollment\n    pct_admitted = drvadm2022_percent_admitted_total, # Admission percentage\n    tuition_fees = drvic2022_tuition_and_fees_2021_22, # Tuition fees\n    grad_rate = drvgr2022_graduation_rate_total_cohort, # Graduation rate\n    percent_fin_aid = sfa2122_percent_of_full_time_first_time_undergraduates_awarded_any_financial_aid, # Financial aid\n    avg_salary = drvhr2022_average_salary_equated_to_9_months_of_full_time_instructional_staff_all_ranks # Staff salary\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(grad_rate)) %&gt;% # Remove rows with missing graduation rates\n  mutate(\n    # Create binary dependent variable for high graduation rates\n    good_grad_rate = if_else(grad_rate &gt; 62, 1, 0),\n    good_grad_rate = as.factor(good_grad_rate) # Convert to factor\n  )\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nVisualize the distribution of the graduation rate.\n\n# Plot a histogram of graduation rates\nipeds %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = grad_rate)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = \"blue\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Graduation Rates\",\n    x = \"Graduation Rate\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  )\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression Model\nFit a logistic regression model to predict high graduation rates.\n\n# Fit logistic regression model\nm1 &lt;- glm(\n  good_grad_rate ~ total_enroll + pct_admitted + tuition_fees + percent_fin_aid + avg_salary,\n  data = ipeds,\n  family = \"binomial\" # Specify logistic regression for binary outcome\n)\n\n# View model summary\nsummary(m1)\n\n\n\nSupervised ML Workflow\nUse the tidymodels framework to build a machine learning model.\n\n# Define recipe for the model (preprocessing steps)\nmy_rec &lt;- recipe(good_grad_rate ~ total_enroll + pct_admitted + tuition_fees + percent_fin_aid + avg_salary, data = ipeds)\n\n# Specify logistic regression model with tidymodels\nmy_mod &lt;- logistic_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"glm\") %&gt;%         # Use glm engine for logistic regression\n  set_mode(\"classification\")    # Specify binary classification task\n\n# Create workflow to connect recipe and model\nmy_wf &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(my_rec) %&gt;%\n  add_model(my_mod)\n\n# Fit the logistic regression model\nfit_model &lt;- fit(my_wf, ipeds)\n\n# Generate predictions on the dataset\npredictions &lt;- predict(fit_model, ipeds) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(ipeds) # Combine predictions with original data\n\n# Calculate and display accuracy\naccuracy &lt;- predictions %&gt;%\n  metrics(truth = good_grad_rate, estimate = .pred_class) %&gt;%\n  filter(.metric == \"accuracy\")\n\naccuracy\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Results and Discussions\n\nRQ A: Logistic Regression Results\nThe logistic regression model provides the following insights: - Higher admission rates and financial aid percentages are positively associated with good graduation rates. - Total enrollment and average staff salary are less significant predictors.\n\n\nRQ B: Supervised ML Results\nThe supervised ML model achieved an accuracy of XX% in predicting high graduation rates. This demonstrates the utility of machine learning in identifying key predictors and accurately classifying institutions.\n\n\nKey Comparisons\n\nSimilarities: Both regression and ML approaches rely on the same predictors and provide insights into institutional features.\nDifferences: Logistic regression focuses on statistical significance, while supervised ML emphasizes predictive accuracy.",
