Within these six sections are specific chapters, which serve as toolkit \"entries\". While the section overviews (the first bullet point within each section) introduce the techniques or methodologies used in the section's chapters, the entries (the subsequent bullet points) are intended to address a specific, narrow problem, as well a to provide a sample for researchers in writing their research questions, methods, results (and discussions) sections based on the analyses. 1.1 Section 1 - Getting StaRted Abstract: In this section, we will introduce the steps to get started with using R and RStudio. The section will also cover the key concepts in working with R such as packages, R markdown. We will also cover important steps in preparing data, which we will be using frequently in the rest of the book. Since these topics have been covered in so much more detail in other books, or other resources online, we will end the section with a list of key resources on these topics that are easily accessible online. Section Overview Using R and RStudio Foundational skills: Data, packages, functions, projects Reproducibility and R Markdown documents Base R: assignment, equality, dollar-sign indexing, xx R files Core Data Wrangling Capabilities Selecting and renaming variables Creating new variables Arranging variables Joining data 1.2 Section 2 - Text Data Abstract: Text data is one of the data formats that social scientists use frequently in their research. Traditionally, text data can come from direct sources (e.g., open-ended survey responses, student reflections, discussion posts, Twitter data), it can also come from indirect sources, too (e.g., interview transcripts). Although, conventionally, qualitative data analysis approaches based in human-coding have been used commonly in social science research with text data, in this section, we will discuss how computational methods can be used with text data. More specifically, we will discuss ways to capture the data, and discuss different types of analysis approaches (e.g., dictionary-based, frequency-based, machine learning). Importantly, for each analysis type, we will introduce a sample study with research questions (that you can inspire from), and provide a step by step analysis, and how to write it all up for publication. 1.2.1 2.1.

But, it is also possible that our observations of the world can guide our research questions. In this section, we will discuss how social scientists can look beyond conventional data types, and learn about capturing and analyzing multimodal data.  1.3.1 3.1. Overview 3.2.

It is a technique used to map and measure relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, computers, or other information/knowledge processing entities. SNA can be a useful tool for understanding the team structures, for example, in an online classroom. It can be an additional layer of understanding the outcomes (or predictors) of certain instructional interventions. Used this way SNA can be used to identify patterns and trends in social networks, as well as to understand how these networks operate. Additionally, SNA can be used to predict future behavior in social networks, and to design interventions that aim to improve the functioning of these networks. 1.4.1 4.1. Overview 4.2.

Example data sets include international or national large-scale assessments (e.g., PISA, NAEP) and data from digital technologies (e.g., log-trace data from adaptive mathemathics programs).  1.5.1 5.1.

In this section, we describe how to communicate with colleagues or the wider world through the use of a variety of tools, especially R Markdown and git/GitHub. We also discuss how to collaborate on projects that involve computational methods and \"good\" (flexible yet principled) practices for doing so based on our experience and prior scholarship.
