# Section 2 Introduction — Preparing for Traditional Computational Analyses of Educational Data

## 2.0.1 Overview

This section introduces the core computational methods that form the basis of educational data analysis. Across the next three chapters, you will learn how to analyze **textual**, **relational**, and **numeric** data—three major forms of information that appear in learning environments, institutional records, and educational research projects.

These chapters emphasize hands-on, transparent, and reproducible approaches using R. By engaging with real examples, you will gain practical experience in transforming raw educational data into interpretable results that inform theory and practice.



## 2.0.2 The Analytical Scope of This Section

| Chapter | Data Type | Analytical Focus | Example Research Question |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Chapter 2** | Text Data (unstructured) | Natural language processing, tokenization, sentiment, topic modeling | “What themes emerge in student reflections or policy statements?” |
| **Chapter 3** | Relational Data | Social network analysis: centrality, community detection, visualization | “How do students or instructors connect and collaborate in learning networks?” |
| **Chapter 4** | Numeric / Big Data | Statistical modeling, regression, clustering, predictive analysis | “Which factors best predict academic outcomes or engagement?” |

> 📚 These three perspectives together illustrate how computational techniques can capture different dimensions of learning—language, interaction, and measurement.


## 2.0.3 Setting Up the Computational Environment

Before exploring the examples, ensure that your R environment contains the essential packages used throughout this section.

``` r
install.packages(c(
  # Core workflow and visualization
  "tidyverse", "ggplot2", "readr", "stringr",

  # Text analysis
  "tidytext", "quanteda", "textdata",

  # Network analysis
  "igraph", "ggraph", "tidygraph",

  # Numeric and machine learning tools
  "caret", "cluster"
))
```

Optional visualization and interaction packages:

``` r
install.packages(c("plotly", "RColorBrewer", "visNetwork"))
```

> 💡 Tip: Use a consistent project structure so each chapter builds on the same foundation:
>
> ```         
> project/
> ├── data/        # datasets
> ├── scripts/     # reusable code
> ├── outputs/     # tables and processed files
> └── figures/     # charts and visualizations
> ```
>
> This structure promotes reproducibility and helps keep analysis pipelines organized.



## 2.0.4 A General Computational Workflow

Regardless of data type, the analytical logic follows a similar cycle:

1.  **Load data** — read files from local or online sources.
2.  **Clean data** — handle missing values, normalize text or numeric fields.
3.  **Transform data** — create tokens, build networks, or scale variables.
4.  **Analyze** — apply the method appropriate to the data form.
5.  **Visualize and interpret** — generate plots and summaries to support interpretation.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("data/example.csv")

cleaned <- data |>
  mutate(across(everything(), str_squish)) |>
  drop_na()

summary(cleaned)
```

> 🧩 This five-step workflow—load, clean, transform, analyze, interpret—appears throughout all chapters in this section.



## 2.0.5 Ethics, Transparency, and Reproducibility

Educational data often include sensitive or identifiable information.

Responsible computational research requires attention to both ethical and methodological rigor.

-   **Privacy:** Remove or anonymize all personal identifiers.
-   **Transparency:** Keep analysis scripts in Quarto or R Markdown files for version control.
-   **Reproducibility:** Record package versions and parameters used in each analysis.
-   **Interpretability:** Combine quantitative patterns with contextual educational insight.

> ⚖️ Ethical and transparent practices ensure that computational results remain credible, interpretable, and usable for improving learning.


## 2.0.6 Transition to Analytical Chapters

With the environment prepared and workflow established, you are ready to begin applying computational methods to real educational data:

-   **Chapter 2 — Text Analysis:** Working with unstructured language to uncover patterns in meaning and discourse.
-   **Chapter 3 — Network Analysis:** Examining connections and relationships among learners, instructors, or resources.
-   **Chapter 4 — Numeric and Big Data:** Exploring structured data to identify trends and predictors in education.

> The following chapter begins with text data, illustrating how natural language processing can transform qualitative information into structured, interpretable results.
