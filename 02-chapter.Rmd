# Section 2 - Text Data

## Abstract
Text data is one of the data formats that social scientists use frequently in their research. Traditionally, text data can come from direct sources (e.g., open-ended survey responses, student reflections, discussion posts, Twitter data), it can also come from indirect sources, too (e.g., interview transcripts). Although, conventionally, qualitative data analysis approaches based in human-coding have been used commonly in social science research with text data, in this section, we will discuss how computational methods can be used with text data. More specifically, we will discuss ways to capture the data, and discuss different types of analysis approaches (e.g., dictionary-based, frequency-based, machine learning). Importantly, for each analysis type, we will introduce a sample study with research questions (that you can inspire from), and provide a step by step analysis, and how to write it all up for publication.
