We're not going to teach you RStudio comprehensively—excellent resources already exist for that purpose. We particularly recommend [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), [*Data Science in Education Using R*](https://datascienceineducation.com/), the [RStudio primers](https://posit.co/resources/primers/), and [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/).

Instead, this chapter covers just enough to reproduce our workflows and extend them to your own data science work. Think of this as the minimal viable setup for doing the work in this book.

## Three Ways to Write R Code

RStudio supports multiple file types for writing R code. You'll encounter all three in data science work:

### R Scripts (.R)

Plain text files containing R code, executed line-by-line or all at once. Great for data processing pipelines, functions, and code you'll reuse.

Create one: File → New File → R Script

``` r
# This is an R script
# Lines starting with # are comments
data <- read.csv("mydata.csv")
summary(data)
```

### R Markdown (.Rmd)

Documents that weave together narrative text (in Markdown) and code chunks. When you "knit" an R Markdown file, it executes the code and generates a formatted document (HTML, PDF, or Word).

You should know R Markdown exists because you'll encounter it in older resources and projects, but we're not using it in this book.

### Quarto (.qmd)

Quarto is the successor to R Markdown, with better multi-language support (R, Python, Julia) and more consistent syntax. It's what we'll use throughout this book.

Create one: File → New File → Quarto Document

The structure looks similar to R Markdown, but the rendering engine is more powerful:

```` markdown
---
title: "My Analysis"
format: html
---

## Introduction

This is regular text.
```{{r}}
# This is a code chunk
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```
````

Click the "Render" button (or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K) to execute all code and generate your document.

**Key difference for beginners**: Think of R scripts as "just code" and Quarto as "code + explanation + output" in one document. Use scripts for behind-the-scenes work, Quarto for analysis you want to share or understand later.

## Console vs. Source: Exploration vs. Preservation

A common pattern in data science work:

-   **Console**: Quick exploration, testing ideas, checking output. Code here disappears when you close RStudio.
-   **Source** (scripts/Quarto): Code you want to keep, reproduce, or share. This is your permanent record.

Early on, you might type everything in the Console. That's fine for learning! But as soon as you do something you want to remember, put it in a script or Quarto file.

## When You Get Stuck

### Reading Error Messages

When something goes wrong, R prints an error message in the Console (usually in red). These messages often look cryptic at first, but they're trying to help:

``` r
Error in mean(x) : object 'x' not found
```

This tells you exactly what went wrong: R couldn't find an object called `x`. Either you misspelled it, or you haven't created it yet.

### Getting Help on Functions

R has built-in documentation for every function:

``` r
?mean           # Opens help for the mean() function
??regression    # Searches all help files for "regression"
```

Help files include descriptions, arguments, examples, and related functions.

### Where Computational Social Scientists Get Help

When you're truly stuck, the R community is remarkably helpful:

-   [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/): Welcoming forum for all R questions
-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): Searchable archive of millions of questions
-   [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://rfordatasci.com/): Active Slack workspace

**Pro tip**: Before asking a question, try searching for your error message. Someone has likely encountered it before.

Of course, turning to AI can also help, as we describe next.

### Large Language Models and AI Tools

In Section 3, we cover using large language models as part of a research workflow. But LLMs are also useful for getting unstuck when you're learning—and this is increasingly how working data scientists operate.

Two approaches work well:

1.  **Ask LLMs directly**: ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred model can explain error messages, suggest debugging approaches, and clarify confusing documentation. Copy your error message, describe what you were trying to do, and ask for help.

2.  **Use GitHub Copilot**: An AI coding assistant that works inside your editor (setup covered in the next chapter). It can suggest code completions, explain what existing code does, and generate boilerplate. Think of it as an always-available pair programmer.

The best programmers don't memorize every function—they know how to find answers quickly. LLMs have become part of that toolkit, alongside documentation, Stack Overflow, and experimentation. Use them when you're stuck, but also pay attention to *why* solutions work. That's how you build intuition.

Please see section 1.4 for more information about the relationship between you, data, and LLMs.
