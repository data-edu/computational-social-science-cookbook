We're not going to teach you RStudio comprehensively—excellent resources already exist for that purpose. We particularly recommend [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), [*Data Science in Education Using R*](https://datascienceineducation.com/), the [RStudio primers](https://posit.co/resources/primers/), and [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/).

Instead, this chapter covers just enough to reproduce our workflows and extend them to your own data science work. Think of this as the minimal viable setup for doing the work in this book.

**A note on Positron**: Throughout this book, we use RStudio, but [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) (Posit's newer IDE built on VS Code) offers similar functionality and may appeal to users coming from VS Code or working across R and Python. The R code in this book will work identically in either environment.

## The Four Essential Panes

When you open RStudio, you'll see four panes (though the layout is customizable). Here's what matters for our work:

-   **Source** (top-left): Where you write and edit your code files
-   **Console** (bottom-left): Where R actually executes code and shows results
-   **Environment** (top-right): Shows the objects (data, functions, etc.) you've created
-   **Files/Plots/Help** (bottom-right): Navigate files, view visualizations, and access documentation

You don't need to customize anything yet—the defaults work fine.

## R Projects: The Foundation of Reproducible Work

**Always work in an R Project.** This is the single most important RStudio habit for reproducibility.

An R Project is a folder that contains all files for a particular analysis—data, scripts, outputs—and sets your working directory automatically. This means your code will work on any computer without changing file paths.

To create a new project:

1.  File → New Project
2.  Choose "New Directory" or "Existing Directory"
3.  Name your project (e.g., "my-first-css-analysis")
4.  Click "Create Project"

Notice the `.Rproj` file in your folder? That's your project file. Double-click it to open RStudio with the correct working directory already set.

## Three Ways to Write R Code

RStudio supports multiple file types for writing R code. You'll encounter all three in data science work:

### R Scripts (.R)

Plain text files containing R code, executed line-by-line or all at once. Great for data processing pipelines, functions, and code you'll reuse.

Create one: File → New File → R Script

``` r
# This is an R script
# Lines starting with # are comments
data <- read.csv("mydata.csv")
summary(data)
```

### R Markdown (.Rmd)

Documents that weave together narrative text (in Markdown) and code chunks. When you "knit" an R Markdown file, it executes the code and generates a formatted document (HTML, PDF, or Word).

You should know R Markdown exists because you'll encounter it in older resources and projects, but we're not using it in this book.

### Quarto (.qmd)

Quarto is the successor to R Markdown, with better multi-language support (R, Python, Julia) and more consistent syntax. It's what we'll use throughout this book.

Create one: File → New File → Quarto Document

The structure looks similar to R Markdown, but the rendering engine is more powerful:

```` markdown
---
title: "My Analysis"
format: html
---

## Introduction

This is regular text.
```{{r}}
# This is a code chunk
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```
````

Click the "Render" button (or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K) to execute all code and generate your document.

**Key difference for beginners**: Think of R scripts as "just code" and Quarto as "code + explanation + output" in one document. Use scripts for behind-the-scenes work, Quarto for analysis you want to share or understand later.

## Console vs. Source: Exploration vs. Preservation

A common pattern in data science work:

-   **Console**: Quick exploration, testing ideas, checking output. Code here disappears when you close RStudio.
-   **Source** (scripts/Quarto): Code you want to keep, reproduce, or share. This is your permanent record.

Early on, you might type everything in the Console. That's fine for learning! But as soon as you do something you want to remember, put it in a script or Quarto file.

## Version Control with Git and GitHub

Git is how computational social scientists share, version, and collaborate on their work. GitHub is the most popular platform for hosting Git repositories.

### Why Git Matters

Without version control, you end up with files like `analysis_final.R`, `analysis_final2.R`, `analysis_ACTUALLY_final.R`. Git tracks every change you make, so you can:

-   Go back to any previous version
-   Experiment without fear of breaking things
-   Collaborate with others without emailing files back and forth
-   Share your work publicly for transparency and reproducibility

### The Git Pane in RStudio

If Git is configured, you'll see a "Git" tab in the Environment pane (top-right). This is where you stage changes, commit them with messages, and push to GitHub—all without leaving RStudio.

Using Git isn't strictly required to follow this book, but it's strongly encouraged. Most data science work lives in Git repositories.

### Setting Up Git and GitHub: A Friendlier Path

Git authentication is famously difficult. We're going to use an opinionated approach that minimizes pain: **Personal Access Tokens (PAT) via the `usethis` package**.

This approach is: - R-native (stays in your comfort zone) - Guided (the package walks you through it) - Good enough for this book's purposes

#### Step 1: Install Required Packages

``` r
install.packages("usethis")
install.packages("gitcreds")
```

#### Step 2: Configure Your Git Identity

Tell Git who you are (one-time setup):

``` r
usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Jane Doe",           # Your actual name
  user.email = "jane@example.com"   # Email associated with GitHub
)
```

**Important**: Use the email address associated with your GitHub account.

#### Step 3: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

``` r
usethis::create_github_token()
```

This opens GitHub in your browser. You'll need to:

1.  Log in to GitHub if you haven't already
2.  Leave the default scopes checked (or at minimum select "repo" and "workflow")
3.  Set expiration to 90 days (we recommend this for security, though you'll need to regenerate the token when it expires)
4.  Click "Generate token" at the bottom
5.  **Copy the token immediately**—GitHub only shows it once!

The token looks like a long random string: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Step 4: Store Your Token in R

``` r
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

When prompted, paste your token and press Enter. R will securely store it for future use.

#### Step 5: Verify Everything Worked

``` r
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

This gives you a diagnostic report. If you see: - Your name and email listed - "Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'"

You're all set! If something looks wrong, see the troubleshooting section below.

### Common Problems & Solutions

**Problem**: "I closed the browser before copying my token"\
**Solution**: No worries—tokens are disposable by design. Run `usethis::create_github_token()` again to generate a new one.

**Problem**: "It worked yesterday, now Git asks for credentials again"\
**Solution**: Your token likely expired. Run `usethis::create_github_token()` again, copy the new token, and run `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` to update it.

**Problem**: "I get 'Permission denied' or authentication errors"\
**Solution**: Check `usethis::git_sitrep()`. Your token may have expired or wasn't stored correctly. Try running `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` again.

**Problem**: "I don't see a Git pane in RStudio"\
**Solution**: Either Git isn't installed on your computer, or RStudio can't find it. See [Happy Git with R, Chapter 6](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) for installation instructions.

### Alternative: SSH Keys (For the Adventurous)

If you plan to use Git extensively beyond this book, SSH keys are more convenient—you set them up once and never think about authentication again. However, they're more complex to configure initially.

If you're interested in the SSH approach, see [Happy Git with R, Chapters 10-12](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html). For now, the PAT method will serve you well.

### Using Git in RStudio

We'll introduce Git commands as you need them throughout the book. For now, know that the Git pane in RStudio gives you a graphical interface for the most common operations:

-   **Pull**: Download changes from GitHub
-   **Commit**: Save a snapshot of your changes with a descriptive message
-   **Push**: Upload your commits to GitHub

You can also use terminal commands (`git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) if you prefer, but the RStudio interface works great for our purposes.

## When You Get Stuck

### Reading Error Messages

When something goes wrong, R prints an error message in the Console (usually in red). These messages often look cryptic at first, but they're trying to help:

``` r
Error in mean(x) : object 'x' not found
```

This tells you exactly what went wrong: R couldn't find an object called `x`. Either you misspelled it, or you haven't created it yet.

### Getting Help on Functions

R has built-in documentation for every function:

``` r
?mean           # Opens help for the mean() function
??regression    # Searches all help files for "regression"
```

Help files include descriptions, arguments, examples, and related functions.

### Where Computational Social Scientists Get Help

When you're truly stuck, the R community is remarkably helpful:

-   [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/): Welcoming forum for all R questions
-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): Searchable archive of millions of questions
-   [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://rfordatasci.com/): Active Slack workspace

**Pro tip**: Before asking a question, try searching for your error message. Someone has likely encountered it before.

Of course, turning to AI can also help, as we describe next

### Large Language Models and AI tools

In section 3, we describe using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a part of a workflow. They can also be helpful for getting unstuck, and, indeed, this is a great tool for data scientists. We recommend two primary ways.

1.  Asking LLMs directly - pick your favorite

2.  Using GitHub copilot (setup described below )
