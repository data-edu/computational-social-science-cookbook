# Section 5 Communication & Collaboration & Good Practices

## Abstract

A key part of social science research (and, any analysis involving computational tools) is communicating about the output or findings. In this section, we describe how to communicate with colleagues or the wider world through the use of a variety of tools, especially R Markdown and git/GitHub. We also discuss how to collaborate on projects that involve computational methods and “good” (flexible yet principled) practices for doing so based on our experience and prior scholarship.
